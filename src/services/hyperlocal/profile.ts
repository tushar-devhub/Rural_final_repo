// ─── Hyperlocal Market Intelligence ───
// Turns the EXISTING RuralBiz analysis (location + radius + business + capital
// → FeasibilityData) into a transparent, business-specific local-market read.
//
// Trust rules (very intentional):
//  • NO new statistics are invented here. Every number comes from the current
//    feasibility object (itself labelled "estimated/simulated" in the app) or
//    is a pure derivation of those numbers (e.g. households per km², consumers
//    per visible business).
//  • Every insight carries a sourceType + confidence so the UI and AI Advisor
//    can say *how* something was determined instead of pretending it is
//    verified local data.
//  • Wording is deliberately cautious ("potential gap", "limited visible
//    competition", "possible underserved segment") — never absolute claims.
//  • This layer NEVER mutates the feasibility score. It only explains how the
//    location/radius/business influenced the existing sub-scores.
